Pyzstd module provides classes and functions for compressing and decompressing data, using Facebook's [Zstandard](http://www.zstd.net) (or zstd as short name) algorithm.

The API style is similar to Python's bz2/lzma/zlib modules.

- Includes zstd v1.5.5 source code
- Can also dynamically link to zstd library provided by system, see [this note](https://pyzstd.readthedocs.io/#build-pyzstd).
- Has a CFFI implementation that can work with PyPy
- Support sub-interpreter on CPython 3.12+
- `ZstdFile` class has C language level performance
- Supports [Zstandard Seekable Format](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/dev/contrib/seekable_format/zstd_seekable_compression_format.md)
- Has a command line interface: `python -m pyzstd --help`
