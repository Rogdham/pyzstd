The `pyzstd` module provides Python support for [Zstandard](http://www.zstd.net), using
an API style similar to the `bz2`, `lzma`, and `zlib` modules.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Zstandard is now natively supported in Pythonâ€™s standard library via the
> [`compression.zstd` module][compression.zstd]. For older Python versions, use the
> [`backports.zstd` library][backports.zstd] as a fallback.
>
> We recommend new projects to use the standard library, and existing ones to consider
> migrating.
>
> See [`pyzstd`'s documentation][doc] for details and a migration guide.
