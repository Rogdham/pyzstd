Introduction
------------

``pyzstd`` module provides classes and functions for compressing and decompressing data, using Facebook's Zstandard (or zstd as short version) algorithm.

The interface provided by this module is very similar to Python's bz2/lzma modules.

Due to the use of Argument Clinic, only supports Python 3.7+.
