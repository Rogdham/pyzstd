Introduction
------------

``pyzstd`` module provides classes and functions for compressing and decompressing data, using Facebook's `Zstandard <http://www.zstd.net>`_ (or zstd as short name) algorithm.

The interface is similar to Python's bz2/lzma module.

* Includes zstd v1.4.5 source code
* Due to the use of `Argument Clinic <https://docs.python.org/3/howto/clinic.html>`_, only supports Python 3.7+
